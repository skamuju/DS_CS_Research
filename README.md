## Description

This project is about building a RL protocol in stock market. We assume secondary market. 

Goal: XXXX

## History / Conventional Method / Motivation

John Doe did XXX. It works in A, but it doesn't work in B. We propose a method that works in B. Don't criticize John Doe. Credit him. But point out that his work can be improved in a different situation that he didn't investigate. 

## Proposed Method

Under circumstance of B (describe above), we propose method XXXXX. Let us describe the procedure below:

 - an equation
 - a flow chart, you then describe
 - a paragraph of algorithms
 - blah blah

## Experiment

This section let us describe the experiment.

### Experiment Design

What is your data? What are you doing with the data? What questions are you answering?

(insert table, charts)

### Algorithm Design

Given that your data is ready (you have the correct data frame, format, blah blah), I want to do
- compute XXX
- execute rolling windows (because it's time series)
- produce a measure that's called buy signal
- blah

(insert charts and equations)

remark: equation here doens't mean PhD math, instead, it means the following: say I want to say the change of stock price is up and down two percent. The equation version can be the following. Let us denote change of stock price to be $\delta$, and stock price for a company $i$ to be $p_i$. Then, the same sentence above can be expressed as $\delta p_i = \pm 2\%$.
