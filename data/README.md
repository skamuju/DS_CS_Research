# README

This is a folder that stores all the data.

## Small Task (to see if you understand the data from the library)

Try use *R* or *Py* to download stock data. 
- Pick a date and see if you can partition stock data before and after this date
- Create a simple moving average line and overlay it on the same data (in *R*, you can use *plot()* or *ggplot2*; in *Py*, use *matplotlib*)
- Compute the average and standard deviation for each column of the stock data

In *R*, the package is *quantmod*. In *Py*, the package is *yfinance*.
